===

A Simple Binary Converter and Number Processor, it accepts 2 integer input from the user. The first is the main number that will get converted to binary then processed. The second is the number that the user wants to find how much of said number is inside the binary. SimpBiCoNPro works with user defined Array, making the user free to customize how many numbers to process and how big each of the numbers are!

The software works like this:
1. User input an integer (for example, 13) as the main number 
2. User input an integer (for example, 1) as the processing number 
3. The program converts the main number to binary (which from the example is 1101)
4. The software find and count how much 1(s) is inside said binary (which from the example is 3)
5. The software shows the result of the total of 1s, to the user.
